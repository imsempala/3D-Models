Documenting the print files I've used to test 3D printing gears and threads. The threads here are threads that were made with the thread utility built in Fusion360 and modified versions of it. The following are shown:

- Default

- -0.1 mm Offset and 0.15 mm Filet

- -0.05 mm Offset and 0.15 mm Filet

The best resulting print with my 3D printer were the -0.1 mm with filet and -0.05 mm with filet.

The -0.1 mm offset w/ 0.15 mm filet resulted in the smoothest fit between the thread and bolt, but the -0.5 mm offset resulted in a tigher fit with more resistance. Depending on the application, either can be used.
