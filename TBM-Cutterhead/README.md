# UW Hyperloop Tunnel Boring Machine Cutterhead

I was part of a RSO at UW called Hyperloop. The goal of hyperloop is to design a fast tunnel boring machine meeting the requirements of the 'Not-A-Boring' competition. I was responsible for the cutterhead and came up with the following design using SolidWorks.

## Design Requirements
The main design requirements were keeping the design low-cost, minimalizing material waste, and ensuring the component was easily manufacturable.
