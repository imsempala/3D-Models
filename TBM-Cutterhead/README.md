# UW Hyperloop Tunnel Boring Machine Cutterhead

I was part of a RSO at UW called Hyperloop. The goal of hyperloop is to design a fast tunnel boring machine meeting the requirements of the 'Not-A-Boring' competition. I was responsible for the cutterhead and came up with the following design using SolidWorks.

## Design Requirements
The main design requirements were keeping the design low-cost, minimalizing material waste, and ensuring the component was easily manufacturable. 

## Initial Design

This was my first attempt at creating the cutterhead. It was one solid body with indents in place for mounting the cutting blades. This iteration fails all three requirements and the design was awful.

## Improved Design
