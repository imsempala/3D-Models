# UW Hyperloop Tunnel Boring Machine Cutterhead

I was part of a RSO at UW called Hyperloop. The goal of hyperloop is to design a fast tunnel boring machine meeting the requirements of the 'Not-A-Boring' competition. I was responsible for the cutterhead and came up with the following design using SolidWorks.

## Design Requirements
The main design requirements were keeping the design low-cost, minimalizing material waste, and ensuring the component was easily manufacturable. 

## Initial Design

This was my first attempt at creating the cutterhead. It was one solid body with indents in place for mounting the cutting blades. This iteration fails all three requirements and the design was awful.

## Improved Design

With this design I split the outer ring into 6 similar pieces and split the center mounting into 3 inner bars that would mount to the outer rings. The inner bars on the other hand are unique parts with only slight differences in manufacturing. Everything is bolted together, making one solid body.

The original design required that a 0.55 m diameter, 0.3 m thick piece of stock be cut to the final dimensions. This was unreasonable given the machinery available to us students, and the availability and cost of the stock. By dividing the component into seperate pieces, material waste and stock availability increases substantially. 

The outer ring components are the same, reducing the complexity for the manufacturer as more of the component is created. The inner bars can be manufactured with straight stock and straight cutting operations. All of the components "slot" into place making assembly straightforward as well.

## Design Flaws

The material where the bolts on the outer-ring are connected is fairly thin in comparison to the entire assembly. I would expect there to be a lot of stress in these areas and further analysis would be needed to determine the safety factor. Solutions include increasing the overlap of the outer-ring parts to allow for more material around the bolts, increasing the width of the outer ring, or increasing the thickness.

The cutting profile of the cutterhead is spiral, meaning that cutters would be placed spiraling from the center. These locations are not set in stone and very difficult to place as it needs to avoid joints and pre-existing bolting holes. The cutters on the inner-bars can be placed in a spiral formation, but beyond the bars, an asymmetrical may be necessary. There are also currently no holes for the cutter existing towards the center of the cutterhead.
