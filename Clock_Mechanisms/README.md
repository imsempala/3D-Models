# Clock Making Journey

This will be documenting my journey with learning clock-making. Everything will be modeled in either Fusion 360 or SolidWorks and presented as an STL file here.

## Escapement

This is the first component I decided to model. There are two parts to the escapement: the Anchor and Escapement Wheel. The anchor rocks back and forth, moving the wheel in steps. The one I modeled is called a Recoil Escapement. The dimensions and design referenced are from "Drawing Clock and Watch Escapements" by the British Horological Institute.

I added a "base" so the components are spaced correctly after 3D printed.
